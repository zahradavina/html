        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
          <li>200 grams ground beef</li>
          <li>3 tbsp pasta sauce</li>
          <li>5 garlics</li>
          <li>3 bayleafs</li>
          <li>1 onion</li>
          <li>1 carrot</li>
          <li>a cup of tomato cherry </li>
          <li>2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 tsp blackpepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Sauté</strong> – Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened</li>
          <li><strong>Cook beef</strong> – Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
          <li><strong>Simmer</strong> – Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
          <li><strong>Slow simmer</strong> option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
          <li><strong>Taste</strong> - and add more salt it desired. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.</li>
<li>Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.</li>
<li>Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes, or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.</li>
<li>Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
